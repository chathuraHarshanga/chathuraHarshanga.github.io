<h1> Well, Hello there! </h1>

Here is my portfolio website that is being built from scratch while learning UX/UI engineering core concepts 
This website only uses HTML 5, CSS and Javascript and i tried to chuck as much as CSS as i can for all the designing without using JS. "why" you may ask, <br> well it is because it's fun!  

if you wanna checkout the website here it isss but maybe it is not done yet!
